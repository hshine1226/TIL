# How is it? How is it like?

- Try this. How is it?
  - 이거 먹어봐. 어때?(비교적 단순한 답변을 듣고 싶음)

- It's really really good. Did you make this?
  - 진짜 맛있다. 너가 만든거야?

- Yeah. I made it.

- You're a really good cook.
  - 너 진짜 요리 잘한다.



- How was it? (Was it good?)

- Oh, there's a new James Bond movie.

- Yeah. Actually, I saw that the other day.
  - 사실 며칠 전에 그거 봤어

- Oh, how was it? Was it good?

- It was Ok. Nothing too impressive. It was pretty much what you would expect from a James Bond movie.
  - 괜찮았어. 엄청 대단하거나 그런건 없었어. 너가 충분히 예상할만한 그런거였어.



- I just got released from quarantine a couple of days ago.
  - 며칠 전에 격리에서 막 풀려났어.
- Oh! What was it like?
  - 아 어땠어?(그것에 대해 알고싶고 궁금하다)
- Well, it wasn't so bad for the first couple of days but after that it was like torture.
  - 첫 며칠은 그렇게 나쁘지 않았는데 그 뒤로는 고문 같았어.



- How is it living abroad? 
  -  해외에서 사는건 좀 어때? 
- What is it like working from home? 
  - 재택근무하니까 어때?
